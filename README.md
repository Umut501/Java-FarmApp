# Java-FarmApp
Have used different Swing components to implement an application with a GUI.
Have practiced how to use event-driven programming. 
Have practiced to use streams to store the relevant data in external files.
Have practiced JDBC API,Multithreading in Java and Object serialization API in Java. 
Have practiced how to use Java Security API (in particular, MD5 implementation).  
This has two aims: to learn how to connect a Java application to a backend database;
to learn how to use part of the object serialization and Java Security API, and multithreading.
