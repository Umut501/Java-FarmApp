# Java-FarmApp
I used different Swing components to implement an application with a GUI.
I practiced how to use event-driven programming. 
I practiced using streams to store the relevant data in external files.
I practiced JDBC API, Multithreading in Java, and Object serialization API in Java. 
I practiced how to use Java Security API (in particular, MD5 implementation).  
This project had three aims: 
To learn how to connect a Java application to a backend database;
To learn how to use part of the object serialization and Java Security API.
To learn how to implement multithreading.
